# Are you anxious, are you depressed or is it difficult to deal with your anger feelings? If your answer is "yes" or if you feel that there are some communication problems in the family or at work, that could use a bit of repair, then coaching or counseling may be a wise investment for the good health of you and your family. Counseling is available in German, English, French and Luxemburgish!
